## Docker Network.

Network: A Docker network is a virtual network that connects containers. 
         Networks provide isolation and allow containers to communicate
         with each other using IP addresses or DNS-based service discovery.


We can create our own network using:

# docker network create <name_of_network>



Here is an example of running mongo container using all the things we have learned so far,

docker run  -d 
-p 27017:27017 
-e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=sajan
-e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password 
--name mongodb
--network mongo-network
mongo

Here,

-p => stands for port 
-e => stands for environment variable
--name => stands for giving name to the container.
--network => assign the container to the certain network.

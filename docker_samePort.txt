### Docker Port binding

Suppose we have two container running on port 6379
Then at that time, we need to do port binding.
For that

docker run -p<port_number_which_you_want_it_to_run>:<port_number_to_be_bined> mage_name
For eg:
docker run -p6380:6379 redis    

Here, we have binded the port to run in 6380 instead of 6379
